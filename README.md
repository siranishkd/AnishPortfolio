## Project 1: [Analysing IMDb Movies Ratings](https://movieanalytics.netlify.app/)
### Description / Problem Statement 
In recent years, there has been a rush towards creating more digital content to capture user attention. Streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV are creating their own content that could rival existing film production companies. With more digital content and content producers, competition between film companies for viewership are heating up. Hence, it is becoming increasingly urgent and important to understand the factors that result in successful movies.

To understand the factors that result in successful movies, our team has decided to analyse IMDBâ€™s official dataset (IMDb, n.d.), given that the company does not permit any form of web scraping on its site. The dataset contained over 100,000 movies since 1900 and provides a variety of information such as ratings, number of votes, genre, duration and publishing year.

Based on research, it was only in the late 1980s, where the modern trends of movies having a higher proportion of foreign box office than domestic ticket sales occur (Hall & Neale, 2010), suggesting that more international audiences viewed the movie than in the country of production. Hence, to provide an analysis of movies that will more likely suit global audiences, our team has decided to restrict the analysis to only movies produced from 1990 to 2019.

Our project is exploratory in nature and it aims to:

1. Examine if genre, duration of movie and year of release will affect the success (ratings) of the movies from 1990 to 2019.

2. Create a model to measure the effect of genre on the ratings of movies.

3. If point 2 is true, check if there is any effect of movie duration on genre and ratings.
