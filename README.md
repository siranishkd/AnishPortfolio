## Project 1: [Analysing IMDb Movies Ratings](https://movieanalytics.netlify.app/)
### Application: [IMDb Movie Rating R Shiny App](https://moviesmakerassistance.shinyapps.io/try_shiny_dropdown_genre_1/)
### Description / Problem Statement 
In recent years, there has been a rush towards creating more digital content to capture user attention. Streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV are creating their own content that could rival existing film production companies. With more digital content and content producers, competition between film companies for viewership are heating up. Hence, it is becoming increasingly urgent and important to understand the factors that result in successful movies.

To understand the factors that result in successful movies, we analyse IMDBâ€™s official dataset (IMDb, n.d.), given that the company does not permit any form of web scraping on its site. The dataset contained over 100,000 movies since 1900 and provides a variety of information such as ratings, number of votes, genre, duration and publishing year.

Based on research, it was only in the late 1980s, where the modern trends of movies having a higher proportion of foreign box office than domestic ticket sales occur (Hall & Neale, 2010), suggesting that more international audiences viewed the movie than in the country of production. Hence, to provide an analysis of movies that will more likely suit global audiences, we will restrict the analysis to only movies produced from 1990 to 2019.

This project is exploratory in nature and it aims to:

1. Examine if genre, duration of movie and year of release will affect the success (ratings) of the movies from 1990 to 2019.

2. Create a model to measure the effect of genre on the ratings of movies.

3. If point 2 is true, check if there is any effect of movie duration on genre and ratings.

### Key Skills 
1. R programming (R Markdown, R Shiny)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Visualisations
4. Statistics and Machine Learning
* Analysis of Variance
* Correlation Analysis
* Simple Linear Regression & Multiple Linear Regression, with Interaction Effects
* Model Comparisons and assumptions checking

## Project 2: [Streaming Services Visualisation and Analytics](https://rpubs.com/anishkd/streamingserviceviz)
### Description / Problem Statement 
As an avid Netflix user, this project provides an avenue to combine my interests in data visualisation and my favorite hobby of watching shows to analyse and gain useful data insights.

Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu are creating their own content that could rival existing film production companies. Netflix currently still owns the crown as being the leading content provider in this sector though others like Disney+ and Hulu are quickly catching up.

This project will look into the following two things:
1) Overview and EDA of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Movies
2) Deep Dive into Netflix content database

Overall this visualisation story is exploratory in nature to find some meaningful insights

### Key Skills

* Tree Map
* Pie Chart
* Boxplot
* Heat Map
* Word Cloud
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Wrangling and Cleaning
