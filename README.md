1. Motivation behind topic
* As a huge movie enthusiast, this project provides an avenue to combine my interests in data visualisation and movies to analyse and gain useful data insights.

* In recent years, there has been a rush towards creating more digital content to capture user attention. Streaming services like Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV are creating their own content that could rival existing film production companies. With more digital content and content producers, competition between film companies for viewership are heating up. Hence it would be interesting to identify factors that result in a successful movie.
